The SMS spam detection project is an end-to-end machine learning application designed to automate the process of identifying spam messages in SMS text. The project begins with **data cleaning**, where noise and irrelevant information are removed to ensure the quality of the dataset. This step is crucial for building a reliable model. 

Following data cleaning, **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is conducted to gain insights into the distribution and characteristics of the data. This analysis helps in understanding patterns, such as the frequency of words in spam versus non-spam messages, which can be critical for feature engineering.

The next phase is **text preprocessing**, where the text data is transformed to a format suitable for modeling. This includes steps like tokenization, lowercasing, removing stop words, and stemming. **Stemming** is particularly important as it reduces words to their root forms, helping the model generalize better by treating words with similar meanings as the same.

After preprocessing, the project moves on to **model building**. Various machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or even neural networks, can be used to train the model on the processed data. The model is then fine-tuned to improve its accuracy in distinguishing between spam and legitimate messages.

Finally, the model is deployed using **Streamlit**, a powerful framework for creating web apps with Python. The application is hosted locally, providing users with a simple and interactive interface where they can input SMS text and instantly receive a prediction on whether the message is spam or not. This deployment makes the model accessible and easy to use, turning the project into a practical tool for spam detection.
